I am taking over from the old maintainer, Ian Walker, with Ian's agreement. 

Ian's e-mail address has changed to ian.walker@swansea.ac.uk. The e-mail account given in the DESCRIPTION file of the archived r2stl package has been closed.

The deprecated package license CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 has been updated to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
